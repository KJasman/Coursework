# SENG265 Course Projects

This repository contains all the projects completed for the SENG 265 course in Summer 2023, under the guidance of Dr. Hausi Muller.

## Overview

The projects in this repository are primarily written in C and are designed to demonstrate various programming concepts and skills. They include programs demonstrating dynamic memory managment, reading and processing .ics calendar files, and more.

## Projects

### Music Manager

A C program that analyzes song data, pulled from several CSV files. The program takes command line arguments to specify criteria for sorting, the number of top songs to display, and the file names to read from. It then reads the files, parses the songs, and prints out the top songs based on the specified criteria in a CSV format.

A corresponding Python implementation is included.

### Calendar Event Reader

A C program that reads and processes .ics calendar files. The program takes command line arguments to specify a date range and a file to read from. It then reads the file, parses the events, and prints out the events that fall within the specified date range in a simplified format.
